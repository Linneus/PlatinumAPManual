# PlatinumAPManual
A Manual Randomizer for Pokémon Platinum, for use with the [Archipelago Manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago) Project.

To prepare the ROM file:


## Patching and Randomizing Your ROM

Included with your download is two xdelta patches and the xdelta program.
Open xdeltaUI.exe, and then choose whether you’d like to play in the original 30FPS, or with the patched 60FPS game, then open the corresponding .xdelta file as your Patch, your Pokémon Platinum ROM (which must be a clean Rev 1, also known as 1.1, which is the most common variant of the game) as your Source File, and then you’ll select a spot to save your modified ROM in Output File. Be sure to add “.nds” to the name of the file. If you don’t do this, you’ll have to add the file extension after the fact.

## 30FPS vs. 60FPS

The normal patch will leave the game unchanged compared to its original DS release. However, the 60FPS patch will speed up many sections and aspects of the game, most noticeable in making all battle animations much snappier. This is slightly more taxing on one’s computer, and certain areas (most noticeably Eterna Forest) struggle to maintain a constant framerate with this patch. The Super Rod, which requires very precise timing in 30FPS, becomes nearly unreactable in 60FPS as well.

## Downloading and Using the Randomizer

Next, download the most recent version of Universal Pokémon Randomizer ZX from [this link](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases), and open the program with the launcher file. In the top right, click “Open ROM” and open your modified ROM.

Given that you just opened a modified ROM, you can expect to see the red text and the “Unofficial ROM” support. From here, modify your settings just as you would with any randomizer! For the most part, any and all settings are entirely up to you, but I will discuss a few of them, both for what this Manual is built around and what you can expect from these settings.


## TM/HMs & Tutors

If you are randomizing TMs, you must keep Field Moves! Otherwise, you lose access to TM70 (Flash) and Flash is considered in-logic for this randomizer. Consider it like Rock Smash in Crystal. This has the side effect of keeping TM28 as Dig.

## Items

Randomizing items allows you to ignore just about all the filler items you receive through the Archipelago client and just treat the pickups in-game *as* your filler.

Banning Bad Items will remove things like mail and useless berries, which are not in the Manual’s item pool, so this option will bring you closer to what the Manual would give you anyway.

## Foe Pokémon

These options will be the primary source of difficulty for you. Bear in mind that you could get sent as far as Stark Mountain, fighting trainers with Level 60 Pokémon, so be mindful of how difficult you want to make the game.

Raising the level of trainers is straightforward (you may want to raise the level of Wild Pokémon to compensate), and giving them fully evolved Pokémon will also make for a more consistently challenging game.

I’ve found that, above everything else, “Better Movesets” was one of the most consistently challenge-raising options I would encounter, as opponents would frequently have excellent moves to deal with me, even if I was ten or twenty levels higher than them.

Extra Pokémon and held items will only increase the difficulty from there. Lastly is Double Battle Mode, which is exactly what it implies; bear in mind that every trainer will have at least two Pokémon and be a double battle. (If you’ve played Emerald AP and tried to use the 100% Double Battle chance, you’ll understand why I explain this.)

Similarly, there are options for an easier game, so tailor the experience to what you desire! With just a few of these options bumped up, I’ve found that this is absolutely the hardest Pokémon game I’ve played in Archipelago.

## Saving your ROM

When you’re done, hit “Randomize (Save)” in the top right to name/save your newly randomized ROM somewhere. You may also consider using the “Save Settings” option to revisit your options easily in the future.
